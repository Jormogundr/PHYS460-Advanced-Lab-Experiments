#Description: To calibrate a Hall sensor circuit the sensor was mounted in the center of a Slink solenoid. The orientation of the sensor face was perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the solenoid so that it would capture maximum B flux.  The voltage output of the sensor circuit was measured as a function of the current through the solenoid. The solenoid has 50 turns per 52 centimeters.
#Column 1: Current in amperes.
#Column 2: Voltage in volts.
#Column 3: Uncertainty in current. This is the display uncertainty based on the number of digits reported. No record of the meter used.
#Column 4: Uncertainty in voltage. This is the display uncertainty based on the number of digits reported. No record of the meter used.
