#Description: Record of polarizer angle of rotation needed to return light intensity to a preset B=0 value as a function of applied B. The applied B is due to the current in TeachSpin Faraday rotation apparatus.  Here, the current in the solenoid is given, as a quantity that is proportional to B.  The current can be converted to a B field value once the solenoid has been calibrated.
#Column 1: Current through TeachSpin solenoid in Amperes.
#Column 2: Angle of rotation of polarizer to return light intensity to its B = 0 value in degrees.
#Column 3: Estimated uncertainty in the current based on the number of digits reported. No record of meter used, or its most recent calibration.
#Column 4: Estimated uncertainty in the angle reading. About 0.5 degrees. Angles were read by eye from the angle markings on the polarizer. Half-degree resolution in a single measurement.
