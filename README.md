# PHYS460-Advanced-Lab-Experiments
A collection of the experiments performed in UM Dearborn's Advanced Lab PHYS460 Winter 2021 section. 

The experiments follow a similar workflow. Some of them required more coding than others - many contain both Jupyter notebooks and all in one .py programs.

For a more formal presentation of work, I'd suggest reading the pdf report associated with each experiment. Many of the programs used to generate plots, transform data, and collect/analyze data were written expeditiously and were not made to any kind of strict software craftsmanship standard.
